# Assignment 1

hello
In this assignment you will be setting up the software and online tools that you will be using throughout this course. Below there are links and instructions to relevant sites. If you have any problems, you can tweet them using the hashtag #TCLA16. 

The first stop is to create the accounts we will be using: 

1. Start by creating a personal [Github account](https://github.com/join?source=header) *if you do not already have one*.
2. Then create a [Twitter](www.twitter.com) account *if you do not already have one*.
3. Next you will need to install the software we will be using (if you already have them installed make sure they are the latest versions). Links and instructions can be found below for:
   * R
   * RStudio
   * Firefox (it is also possible to install Zotero desktop and not use Firesfox if you prefer)
   * Zotero plugin for Firefox
   * Git

4. Now you can connect your Github account to your RStudio installation. 


5. [Download Zotero references file](https://github.com/data-science-in-ed/Tools) and [upload into Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/support/getting_stuff_into_your_library) 


# Software

In HUDK 4050 we will be using several online services and software packages to set up a learning analytics system. In order to both particpate in the class and collect data from the class all students will need to have operational, up-to-date accounts and installations of these tools.

### You will need to make accounts with the following services.

## [Twitter](www.twitter.com)

Twitter will be used to:
  * Ask questions about the course
  * Comment on readings
  * In class communication (backchannel) including notifying when a student is not following content:
  * For example, if instructions are unclear or the lecture is difficult to follow tweet #TCLA16 #IDKWGO

**All tweets need to be tagged with the hashtag #TCLA16** 

Be a good Twitizen, check out this [etiquette guide](http://mashable.com/2013/10/14/twitter-etiquette/) for engaging on Twitter.

## [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
